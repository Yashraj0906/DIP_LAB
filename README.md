# Digital Image Processing using MATLAB

This repository contains a basic implementation of fundamental Digital Image Processing (DIP) operations using MATLAB. The project focuses on understanding how common image processing techniques work internally by implementing them from scratch.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To help understand the working of core image processing algorithms and concepts by building them manually using MATLAB instead of relying only on built-in functions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Basics of Image Processing  
- Histogram Equalization  
- Wavelet Transformation  
- Tambola Ticket 
- Bit Slicing  

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- MATLAB (any recent version)
- Basic knowledge of matrices and image representation

---

## ▶ How to Run

1. Open MATLAB  
2. Place the input image file in the same folder as the MATLAB script  
3. Open the required `.m` file  
4. Run the script from the MATLAB editor or command window
